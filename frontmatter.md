## Abstract

For this workshop, we will review the ways that you can use Hypothes.is, a versatile digital annotation tool, to enhance your teaching in synchronous and asynchronous contexts. The  Though a bit heavy on the technical side, as Iâ€™m showing you the various different ways of deploying a single tool. The idea is to give you options for using this tool and giving you the expertise to remain flexible as you adapt to different technological contexts. 

The goal of this workshop is twofold: First, to teach you the technical skill of deploying a Hypothes.is (H) for teaching and learning; Second, to brainstorm specific pedagogical methods for using digital annotation. I want you to leave this workshop with concrete skills for using Hypothes.is as well as some ideas for how it might enhance your own goals for the classroom.
