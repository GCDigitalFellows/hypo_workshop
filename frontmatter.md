## Abstract

For this workshop, we will explore how to use [Hypothes.is](https://web.hypothes.is/), a versatile digital annotation tool, to enhance your teaching in synchronous and asynchronous contexts. Throughout the workshop, we review the various options for deploying Hypothes.is for teaching. By introducing participants to the different options of using this tool, the workshop empowers teachers remain flexible as they adapt to student needs and technological contexts. 

Participants will leave this workshop with concrete skills for using digital annotation, as well as some ideas for how it might enhance your own goals for the classroom.  We will examine the following applications for Hypothes.is: first, in a course site on the [CUNY Academic Commons](https://commons.gc.cuny.edu/); second, as a browser extension that can be activated on most webpages; third, by embedding it into your own website; and fourth, by using the URL "prefix" that works for many technological contexts. The idea behind providing several options for using this tool is to endow instructors with the expertise necessary to navigate web-based applications in order to provide students with the path of least resistance for using digital annotation.

### Projects that use these skills

- See Hypothes.is in action [on a short story by Junot Diaz](https://via.hypothes.is/https://engl326spring20.commons.gc.cuny.edu/wp-content/blogs.dir/11194/files/2020/03/invierno.pdf). 

### Ethical Considerations

- Digital Annotation is a great way to experience reading as a social activity. However, whenever exploring new tools for teaching, always consider how technology exposes student data. When annotating in "public mode," student usernames and annotations will be available for anyone to see. Therefore, be mindful of the requirements and expectations for students to identify themselves in usernames and how you (as the instructor) are modeling annotation content and style for students. Make sure that, in opening up reading and writing as social and collective processes, you don't needlessly expose your students. One way to ensure student privacy is to create "reading groups" whose annotations are only visible to group members. This workshop covers how to configure reading groups on the [reading group page](./reading_groups.md).
