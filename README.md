It was first taught at CUNY GC by Filipa Calado in the Spring of 2020 and Summer 2020 as a 1 hour online syncronous workshop. It can also be taught asynchronously. 

Abstract: 

> For this workshop, we will explore Hypothes.is, a versatile digital annotation tool, for social reading online. Throughout the workshop, we review the various options for deploying Hypothes.is on a web browser. By introducing participants to the different options of using this tool, the workshop empowers them to remain flexible in adapting to student needs and technological contexts. Participants will leave this workshop with concrete skills for using digital annotation and some ideas for how it can enhance their own goals for the classroom.
> We will examine the following applications for Hypothes.is: first, in a course site on the CUNY Academic Commons; second, as a browser extension that can be activated on top of most webpages; third, by embedding it into the code of a website; and fourth, by using the URL "prefix" as a workaround or backup plan. Learning to use these various options allow instructors to provide students with the path of least resistance for using digital annotation.

## Requirements
Students should have access to a web browser that can download a plugin.
