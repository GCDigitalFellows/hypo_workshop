# Brainstorm

Since this workshop is asynchronous, I'll replace the usual icebreaker (where we go around the room and introduce ourselves) with a moment of brainstorming about our intentions for working with Digital Annotation. We will begin, then, by taking five minutes acquaint ourselves with where we are coming from and what we hope to learn here.

On a sheet of paper or blank text document, explain your interest in Digital Annotation. What has your experience been in the past? And how do you want or hope to use Digital Annotation in the future? Though you might not have a full idea of Digital Annotation at this point, try to brainstorm possible goals or strategies for how it could enhance your teaching. How might Digital Annotation complement your work as an instructor? Take no more than five minutes for your brainstorm.

I'll start: 
> I've been using Digital Annotation in almost all the English classes that I've taught at Hunter College, CUNY, for the past four years. When I taught English 220: Introduction to Writing about Literature, my goal was to use Digital Annotation to model close reading pratices, particularly identifying and analyzing "literary devices" like metaphor and irony. In other classes, I moved from using annotation to model close reading to using it to encourge my students explore and extrapolate on their own interests when they read. I instructed them to highlight what sticks out to them and to explain why they found it striking. The goal was to get my students to connect discrete moments in narrative to ideas and themes from the work at large. For the future, I'm thinking about annotation in a new way, and I'm more interested in highlights than textual responses. How it might annotation engage embodied reactions or feelings that occur during the reading process? Specifically, I've been playing around with highlighter colors to indicate different kinds of nonverba or preverbal responses to reading. By using annotation in alternative ways, I hope to open up how we read and engage with texts online.

# What is Digital Annotation?

Now that we have a stronger sense of what we hope to gain with Digital Annotation, let's jump into the basics. We will begin by unpacking the definition of **Digital Annotation**. 

> Digital Annotation is the use of *digital tools* to *mark up* electronic text. It can be used individually (for self-study and research purposes) or in groups for teaching, (i.e. *social annotation*). 

Let's unpack the terms in italics. 

*Digital tools*: an application, either standalone (something you download) or on the web, as a plugin (browser tool) or attached/embedded to a website.  

*Mark up*: adding comments and/or highlights to text in order to emphasize specific words, phrases, passages. Can be used to indicate moments of interest, questions, confusion, conflict or another reaction. 

*Social Annotation*: When you use digital annotation tools to read texts online, with othes. Can be in a classroom setting, other academic setting, or public setting.

Let's look at some examples of digital annotation tools within teaching environments. 

First is **Adobe Reader/Acrobat**, a standalone app (meaning that you download the application and it lives on your computer) that allows you to highlight and comment on PDFs.

Second is **Googledocs**, is a web app (an application in your web browser) that can be used to draft, highlight, and comment text with others.

# Pegagogy Goals

This exercise works well with a partner or small group, but you can complete it on your own. 
- How are you or people you know already deploying annotation tools or techniques in reading, research, teaching, learning? Or, come up with ways that you would want to use annotation for research or the classroom. Come up with examples that address your own goals and needs with digital annotation. You can say things like, "To take notes on web articles for PhD qualifying exams" or "To model 'close reading' for English classes, especially examples of working with literary devices." 

 
# Up and Running with H

Hypothes.is comes as a browser plugin and embedded tool to highlight/comment with yourself or others.
